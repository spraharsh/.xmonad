# xmonad configuration

My personal xmonad configuration built on top of [Vic Fryzel's](https://github.com/vicfryzel/xmonad-config). with a few changes of my own. the xmobar and NoBorders style works best with setting solarized as the default theme over a few applications using the background as `#002b36`.
